README

Version 0.9

Importend: You need to download the exe and dll file for the game to working. (Both need to be in the same folder)
The sb file is just small basic file format + there if you want to chekc the code.

I made the Game actuall normal playable without any issues (I hope).

This is a small not finished RPG in small basics

some things aren't 100% finished like coloring action and enemy ki.

Everything is in german. Perhaps I translate it at some one point.

Up to 27 enemies, some option what to do, 6 Bosses / Stages to explore, everything text based.
